Excludes alternative provision and independent schools.\n- Figures for 2022 are based on revised data.\n- Figures for Isles of Scilly and City of London are based on a single school in each local authority and therefore figures have been suppressed.\n- Users are advised to take care when interpreting writing and science teacher assessment measures and reading, writing and maths (combined) measures for West Sussex, particularly when making comparisons over time or between local authorities.",
